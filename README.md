# ~/Library/Services

This is the Services directory on my Mac.
The Services directory contains Automator workflows that appear in the menu bar and right-click menu within applications.

Each workflow has a README inside it explaining what it does and how to use it.

Make sure to clone this repository recursively.

To install some of the services, you need to run `install.sh`.
