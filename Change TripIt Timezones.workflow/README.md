# Change TripIt Timezones

Sometimes, [TripIt](https://www.tripit.com) will guess my destinations wrong, and then they end up being in the wrong timezone, which _really_ screws up my calendar.

When you activate this workflow on a TripIt trip edit page, it changes all timezones to Europe/London. You still need to save the changes.
